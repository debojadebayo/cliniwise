# Backend
## Setup Dev Workspace
1. Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#automatic-installer) and then use it to install the Python version in `.python-version`.
    1. install pyenv with `curl https://pyenv.run | bash`
    * This step can be skipped if you're running from the devcontainer image in Github Codespaces
1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
    * This step can be skipped if you're running from the devcontainer image in Github Codespaces
1. Run `poetry shell`
1. Run `poetry install` to install dependencies for the project
1. Create the `.env` file and source it. The `.env.development` file is a good template.
    1. `cp .env.development .env`
    1. `set -a`
    1. `source .env`
1. Run the database migrations with `make migrate`
1. Run `make run` to start the server locally
    - This spins up the Postgres 15 DB & Localstack in their own docker containers.
    - The server will not run in a container but will instead run directly on your OS.
        - This is to allow for use of debugging tools like `pdb`
1. I've got a directory that has sample clinical guidelines. There's a handy script that I've lifted from SEC insights to set this up. Run `make seed_db` to seed the database with the existing documents     
        - At some point you will want to do the same for the other secret keys in here like `AWS_KEY`, & `AWS_SECRET`
    - Source the file again with `set -a` then `source .env`
        - If this step fails, you may find it helpful to run `make refresh_db` to wipe your local database and re-start with emptied tables.
    - Done üèÅ! You can run `make run` again and you should see some documents loaded at http://localhost:8000/api/document

## Scripts
The `scripts/` folder contains several scripts that are useful for both operations and development.

## Chat ü¶ô
The script at `scripts/chat_llama.py` spins up a repl interface to start a chat within your terminal by interacting with the API directly. This is useful for debugging issues without having to interact with a full frontend.

The script takes an optional `--base_url` argument that defaults to `http://localhost:8000` but can be specified to make the script point to the prod or preview servers. The `Makefile` contains `chat` & `chat_prod` commands that specify this arg for you.

Usage is as follows:

```
$ poetry shell  # if you aren't already in your poetry shell
$ make chat
poetry run python -m scripts.chat_llama
